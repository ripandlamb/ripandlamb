We are deeply saddened to announce that unfortunately, due to the effects of the pandemic and the ongoing restrictions, Ripley and Lambert has had to close permanently.

I wanted to say a huge and heartfelt thank you to everyone who has worked at Ripley and Lambert, hosted an event here, helped and supported the shop, and to everyone who has been a customer with us.

Final report of the commercial star-ship Nostromo, Hasta la vista baby, and May the Force be with you...
