Due to the ongoing threat from COVID-19 we have taken the decision to temporarily close Ripley and Lambert until further notice.
We have also postponed all our upcoming events until further notice.
We will keep you updated via social media on the reopening of the shop and rescheduling of our events.
Stay safe and take care of each other.
