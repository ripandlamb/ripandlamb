It’s Ripley and Lambert’s own crafting group and we're back for 2020!
           
Meeting every Saturday between 1 – 3pm in the back room at Ripley and Lambert, all levels and experience welcome.

Either join the group project (currently making crochet Star Wars characters) 
or 
bring your own needlework project 
or 
learn to crochet or knit as a beginner (we can provide the required needles and wool)

No need to book for this free event, just turn up.

See you there!
